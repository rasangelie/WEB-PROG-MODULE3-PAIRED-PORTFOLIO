                        Hello, I'm <b>Angelie</b>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I’m a Computer Science student at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I’m in my
                        19 years of age and currently residing at Riverside, Calinan, Davao City. 
                        My friends like to call me <em><b>bads</b></em>. I’m an introvert type 
                        of person but I really do my best in reaching out and communicating with other people.
                        In junior high school, I studied at Holy Cross College of Calinan and that's 
                        where I first bumped into a computer related subject which is ICT. Senior
                        high school came and was glad because my parents let me enrolled in Malayan Colleges
                        Mindanao wherein I took STEM course.

                        In my spare time, I watch Korean dramas and reality shows.
                        I’m also a fan of their music, filmography, fashion, and arts. I don’t know if its
                        fine but watching Korean dramas and reality shows became a hobby of mine. Nowadays,
                        I'm trying to explore on something that I'm not really interested before just like reading a
                        book and exercising. I also like to watch programming and tour vlogs in youtube.
                        In addition, I’m a person who is really interested in arts and love the idea of
                        travelling to different places and visiting art galleries. And just like other people,
                        I also have a lot of things that I wanted to achieve in life and I hope that I can achieve it 
                        soon in the <a class="link" href="#bottom" href="">future</a>.

                        I’m currently a second year student and throughout my
                        journey, I really learned a lot. I always remind myself to 
                        toughen up because there are times that everything seems so hard.

                        Moreover, learning how to code is not an easy thing to do, there are  
                        instances that  I’m getting annoyed with myself because I struggle a lot when
                        it comes to coding. With that said, I always remind myself that <b>I can do it</b>.

                        My goals and dreams in life is what pushes 
                        me  throughout my journey. Since I was in junior highschool and until now,
                        I really aspire to become a <b>Software Engineer </b>and <b>UI/UX designer</b>.
                        Right now, it seems that my skills in coding is
