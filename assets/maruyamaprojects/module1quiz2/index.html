        <p>
            I am Kagie Angelo Lagrama Maruyama, a Filipino citizen born and raised in Davao City. I am a student of Malayan Colleges Mindanao and I am studying Information Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            While computers and the study of computers are my main fields of study, my passion is in learning languages and how they work, as I am able to speak in, in descending order of fluency: Cebuano, English, Filipino, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this taken into consideration, I also consider myself to be an amateur linguist, since I do my research on East and Southeast Asian Languages, particularly the Sinitic, Japonic, Koreanic, and Austronesian language families. 
            I am also an avid conlang (constructed languages) enthusiast, as I am fluent in one, that conlang being Toki Pona, a constructed language built around the principles of simplicity and minimalism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with learning languages, my other hobbies include reading books, playing video games, and listening to music, standard hobbies that most people my age have in this day and age.
        </p>
        <p>
            My surname is of Japanese origin, since my father is from Osaka, Japan. My mother is from Davao del Norte, Philippines. They decided that I would live with my aunts in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My goals once I reach 30 are to be financially stable and to find a space for myself, whether it be a house and lot or an apartment.
            I would like to be independent from my family and be my own person once I reach my 30's.
